class RingSection:
    r""" Class containing the general properties of a section of the
    accelerator that are independent of the RF system or the beam.

    The user has to input the synchronous data with at least but no more
    than one of the following: momentum, kin_energy, energy, bending_field.

    If bending_field is passed, bending_radius should be passed as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    length : float
        Length [m] of accelerator section on the reference orbit (see
        orbit_length option).
    alpha_0 : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Momentum compaction factor of zeroth order :math:`\alpha_{0}`;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
        If a turn-by-turn program is passed, should be of the same size
        as the synchronous data.
    momentum : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Design particle momentum [eV]
        on the design orbit :math:`p_{s}`;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
    kin_energy : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Design particle kinetic energy [eV]
        on the design orbit :math:`E_{k,s}`;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
    energy : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Design particle total energy [eV]
        on the design orbit :math:`E_{s}`;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
    bending_field : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Design bending field [T] on the design orbit :math:`B_{s}`,
        this is used to defined the design particle momentum;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
    bending_radius : float
        Optional: Radius [m] of the bending magnets,
        required if 'bending field' is set for the synchronous_data_type
    orbit_bump : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Length of orbit bump to add as increment to the design length;
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
        If a turn-by-turn program is passed, should be of the same size
        as the synchronous data.
    alpha_n : float (opt: list or np.ndarray)
        Optional : Higher order momentum compaction can also be passed through
        keyword arguments (orders not limited, e.g. alpha_3 is recognized);
        can be input as single float or as a program (1D array is a
        turn-by-turn program and 2D array is a time dependent program).
        If a turn-by-turn program is passed, should be of the same size
        as the synchronous data.

    Attributes

    length_design : float
        Length of the section on the reference orbit [m]
    length : datatype.machine_program.orbit_length
        Length of the beam trajectory, including possible
        orbit bump programs [m]
    orbit_bump : None or datatype.machine_program.orbit_length
        Length of the orbit bump only if declared by the user [m]
    synchronous_data : datatype.machine_program._ring_program
        The user input synchronous data, with no conversion applied.
