CODE NAME
=========

BLonD_common (Beam Longitudinal Dynamics - Common dependencies)

DESCRIPTION
===========

Collection of common functions and interfaces for codes dedicated to longitudinal
beam dynamics studies in synchrotrons

LINKS
=====

Repository: https://github.com/blond-org/blond_common

Documentation: http://blond-org.github.io/blond_common/

Project website: http://blond.web.cern.ch

INSTALL
=======


Requirements
------------

1. An Anaconda distribution (Python 3 recommended).

2. That's all!


Install Steps
-------------


* The blond_common module is initially meant to be used as a submodule to other code developments. If you would like to add the blond_common module into your own development, you need to:
    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git submodule add https://github.com/blond-org/blond_common.git your_project

* If the blond_common module is included as a submodule into another project, remember to initialize the module using (NB: this will update the submodule to the version defined by the project):
    .. code-block:: bash

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

* The code can also be used standalone (e.g. to use fitting functions)

  1. Clone the repository from github or download and extract the zip from here_.

  2. Add the folder ON TOP of the blond_common module to your PYTHONPATH (e.g. if the folders are structured as /foo/bar/blond_common, you should add the "bar" folder to the PYTHONPATH, see in __EXAMPLES)
